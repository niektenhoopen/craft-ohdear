## Oh Dear Overview

Craft Oh Dear provides deep integration into Craft and saves developer's time by empowering editors.

With Oh Dear you don‘t just monitor your homepage but your entire website. Oh Dear monitors uptime, checks your SSL certificates, detects broken links and mixed content. Craft Oh Dear integrates all this nicely into the Control Panel.

To learn more about the features visit the [plugin store page](https://plugins.craftcms.com/ohdear).

## Configuring Oh Dear

Go to the settings page and paste your Oh Dear API key. (You can create a token on Oh Dears's [API token page](https://ohdear.app/user/api-tokens).) You can choose from the sites of all teams that your personal Oh Dear account belongs to.

Currently there is no multi-site support. You can only connect to a single Oh Dear site from one Craft installation. Multi-site support is on our Roadmap. Let us know if you desperately need it.

## Oh Dear Roadmap

## Questions and answers

### Why not just use Oh Dear‘s dashboard?

As an Oh Dear customer you can be a member of many teams each with their own monitored websites. It is tailored to you as a developer. With Craft Oh Dear you‘ll bring all relevant features to your Craft editors. Empower them to find and fix broken links and mixed content, check app and certificate health, review performance metrics and analyse uptime.

### Does Craft Oh Dear detect 404s?

Oh Dear crawls your website to find broken links that refer to external or internal pages from the point of view of a user that is on your site. Thus it cannot detect 404 errors for users that arrive from outside to your website. For this purpose you may find several other Craft plugins or services that detect 404s to your site when they occure.

### What's Mixed Content?

Take a look at this good explanation on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content).

### Is this an official Oh Dear plugin?

This plugin is independent from Oh Dear. You can see all available 3rd party integrations in [Oh Dear's docs](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/3rd-party-integrations/introduction).
